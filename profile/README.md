# Function AI

![function logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fxnai/.github/main/logo_wide.png)

Run AI prediction functions (a.k.a. "predictors") on mobile, web, and in the cloud--all from a `predict` function in a Jupyter Notebook:
```py
def predict (name: str):
    return f"Hello {name}! Welcome to Function ðŸ˜‰"
```

If you don't have your own predictor, or don't know how to create one, you can use any of the [available predictors on Function](https://fxn.ai/explore). You can make predictions using our client libraries:

- **[Function for Python and CLI](https://github.com/fxnai/fxn)**. Make predictions in your Python, Flask, Django apps, and in the command line.
- **[Function for JavaScript](https://github.com/fxnai/fxnjs)**. Make predictions in your web, Node.js, and React apps.
- **[Function for Unity3D](https://github.com/fxnai/fxn3d)**. Make predictions in your Unity apps and games.
- **[Function for Discord](https://fxn.ai/discord)**. Make predictions in your Discord server chats, using the `/predict` slash command.

We have clients for iOS (Swift) and Android (Java/Kotlin) coming soon! A few useful links:
