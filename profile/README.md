Run Python functions (a.k.a. "predictors") locally on Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, in the browser, and Windows--with full GPU acceleration and zero dependencies:
```ts
import { Function } from "fxnjs"

// ðŸ’¥ Create your Function client
const fxn = new Function({ accessKey: "..." });

// ðŸ”¥ Run predictions on-device
const prediction = await fxn.predictions.create({
  tag: "@fxn/greeting",
  inputs: { name: "Peter" }
});

// ðŸš€ Use the results
console.log(prediction.results[0])
```
