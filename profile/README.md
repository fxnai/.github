# Function AI

![function logo](../logo_wide.png)

Run AI prediction functions (a.k.a. "predictors") on mobile, web, and in the cloud, all from a `predict` function in a Jupyter Notebook:
```py
def predict (name: str):
    return f"Hello {name}! Welcome to Function ðŸ˜‰"
```

And if you don't have your own predictor, or don't know how to create one, you can use any of the [available predictors on Function](https://fxn.ai/explore). You can use these predictors from the clients we provide:

- **[Function for Python](https://github.com/fxnai/fxn)**. Run predictors in your Python, Flask, Django apps, and in the command line.

- **[Function for JavaScript](https://github.com/fxnai/fxnjs)**. Run predictors in your web, Node.js, and React apps.

- **[Function for Unity3D](https://github.com/fxnai/fxn3d)**. Run predictors in your Unity apps and games.

- **[Function for Discord](https://fxn.ai/discord)**. Run predictors in your Discord server, using the `/predict` slash command.

We have clients for iOS (Swift) and Android (Java/Kotlin) coming soon! A few useful links:
